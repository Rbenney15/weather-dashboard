## Overview

Weather Dashboard is a responsive, accessible web application that provides current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any searched city. The project was refreshed to remove framework dependencies and improve both code quality and user experience.

Search history is saved locally so previously searched cities can be revisited quickly.
